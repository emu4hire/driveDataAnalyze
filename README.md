This repository holds tools for analysis of data captured by my DriveData Android app.

--lineFitter is the linefitting algorithm from thresholdDemo.  Takes in a video, adds fitted lines to it for the center
  and side lines, and outputs it.

--vdmaker takes a drivedata folder and produces a video based on the images it has, with a delay defined by the user.
